This is the source code repository for the implementation of the physical architecture for the research.

# Objective
The research of data products completed with an aim to implement it with a real world architecture implementation. It provides a prescriptive data platform design coupled with Azure best practices and design principles. These principles serve as a compass for subsequent design decisions across critical technical domains. The architecture will continue to evolve alongside the Azure platform and is ultimately driven by the various design decisions that organizations must make to define their Azure data journey.

The architecture of data products implementation in typical bankking eniviroment for customer, consists of two core building blocks:

Data Governance consist of data security and data governance capabilities of a bank.
Data Product Enabler which is a data architecture that enables data product using the data from silos implemented using the Azure components.

The architecture is modular by design and allows organizations to start small with a single Data Product for customer and implement data architecture using Azure.
